        <p class="block">There once was a farmer named Guido.  However, he was far from your typical happy-go-lucky hay 
            balen', cow manure shovellen', potato growin' farmer.  Guido had a strong interest in exotic animals and refrained
            from keeping traditional livestock.  On Guido’s farm, there was a monkey named Theodore and a camel named Torstan.  
            Guido had to keep Theodore and Torstan separated because Theodore would often climb onto Torstan’s back and this 
            would give Torstan great anxiety.  So Guido designed an enclosure that would keep Torstan and Theodore separated as 
            well as preventing them from wandering off into the wilderness.

                <p id="fenceCalcDescription">Guido might be good at designing an enclosure for his animals, but he is far from a 
                mathematician and cannot figure out the optimal <i>x</i> & <i>y</i> dimensions that would give Torstan and Theodore the
                maximum area to flonder around.  Fortunately, I have built a quadratic calculator that allows Guido to input the
                amount of fence that he has and returns the optimal <i>x</i> & <i>y</i> dimensions along with the maximum area of the enclosure.
                I have also added an input field that modifies the number of <i>x</i>-values, in case if Guido decides to add more enclosure areas.

        <div id="revenue">
                <p id="revenueDescription" class="block">Guido is satisfied with his enclosure since he can be certain that he has granted
                    Torstan and Theodore the maximum area to roam around.  However, Guido soon came to find that it is very expensive
                    to keep a monkey given the cost of bananas these days.  Guido decided that the best way to fund his exotic animals
                    venture would be to convert his farm into a zoo.  At first things were going well and Guido was making a considerable
                    amount of profit, however he knew that he could further optimize his profits by adjusting the admission price.  Unfortunately,
                    Guido is only minutely savvy in the business world and is no accountant, so he can't figure out how to maximize his revenue.
                    Thankfully, I happen to be knowledgeable in both the fields of quadratics & programming and have built a revenue calculator for
                    Guido.

            <div id="revenueCalc" class="block">
                <p id="revenueCalcDescription">Guido's revenue is represented as price per admission times number of admissions.  Guido's max revenue
                    is represented as a quadratic function.  I have simplified the method of "completing the square" into a series of algebraic
                    equations so that anyone can solve for Guido's max revenue without any knowledge on how quadratics work.  To calculate Guido's
                    max revenue, enter Guido's current price per admission and current number of admissions along with the projected market values.
                    The projected market values are represented as a ratio of variance in price per admission to variance in number of admissions.
                    For example, the default projected market values represent that for every $2 increase in price, 4 less people visit Guido’s zoo.
                    This is also the equivalent of "for every $2 <strong>decrease</strong> in price, 4 <strong>more</strong> people visit Guido's zoo".

                            The below values represent the price that Guido should sell each admission at, the number of admissions yielded as a result of
                            the new price per admission, and the maximum revenue achieved when selling admissions for his zoo at the specified cost.  Please
                            keep in mind that depending on which values you enter in the calculator, the output may not be what was necessarily expected, this 
                            is because the calculator accounts for real world values such as price decimals only go to two places, and you can't sell
                            a fraction of an admission.  Also keep in mind that "<i>x</i> price increase = <i>y</i> admissions decrease", is the same 
                            as "<i>x</i> price decrease = <i>y</i> admissions increase".
