        <h1>Welcome to Guido's Farm!</h1>
        <img src="" alt="Supposed to be an image of Guido and his farm here.">
        <p>There once was a farmer named Guido.  However, he was far from your typical happy-go-lucky hay 
            balen', cow manure shovellen', potato growin' farmer.  Guido had a strong interest in exotic animals and refrained
            from keeping traditional livestock.  On Guido’s farm, there was a monkey named Theodore and a camel named Torstan.  
            Guido had to keep Theodore and Torstan separated because Theodore would often climb onto Torstan’s back and this 
            would give Torstan great anxiety.  So Guido designed an enclosure that would keep Torstan and Theodore separated as 
            well as preventing them from wandering off into the wilderness.

        <div id="fence">
                <p id="fenceDescription">The enclosure was designed as follows:</p>

            <div id="fenceCalc">
                <p id="fenceCalcDescription">Guido might be good at designing an enclosure for his animals, but he is far from a 
                mathematician and cannot figure out the optimal <i>x</i> & <i>y</i> dimensions that would give Torstan and Theodore the
                maximum area to flonder around.  Fortunately, I have built a quadratic calculator that allows Guido to input the
                amount of fence that he has and returns the optimal <i>x</i> & <i>y</i> dimensions along with the maximum area of the enclosure.
                I have also added an input field that modifies the number of <i>x</i>-values, in case if Guido decides to add more enclosure areas.

                    Torstan and Theodore the maximum area to roam around.  However, Guido soon came to find that it is very expensive
                    to keep a monkey given the cost of bananas these days.  Guido decided that the best way to fund his exotic animals
                    venture would be to convert his farm into a zoo. <!--Do research and design calculator-->
